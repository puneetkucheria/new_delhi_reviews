0.1347851677457328, Thanks The food at Coast Cafe last night was horrible ...: 1.1489111241907004, it seems they have a Gujarati chef as the uppams , malabar parathas , the spicy gravy prawn n chicken dishes we ordered we all overpoweringly sweet !!: 0.731606827545615, The uppams could have been passed off as pan cakes ...: 0.017068864037669218, the piture of drink we ordered - Red wine Sangria was also pathetic ... very disappointing food indeed !!: 1.5167745732783988, Notwithstanding its location and potential for attracting a trendy, upmarket crowd, the Coast Cafe's characterization of a boutique destination for casual dining is a rather misleading one.: 0.12301353737492642, I'd visited the place on a Thursday evening after work and walked in to what resembled a restaurant with a

debit card as \"their machine was immovable\".: 1.2548557975279575, I would have been happy to leave a positive review with constructive feedback for the Coast Café to take note of and improve upon, but a brazen lack of any understanding of maintaining and upholding hospitality standards whatsoever would leave any customer with a lot to say albeit devoid of any confidence or trust in the management's ability to deliver.: 0.4949970570924073, limited options, stinking aroma & non co-operative staff.: 0.4002354326074161, Better to stay in Marriot which is a much better value for money.:

other tables.: 1.1606827545615068, Momentarily confused, I wondered what was going on, and made to go back to the other end of the restaurant but the leading waiter tried to walk me through to his

cold drink and not a hot soup We ordered some bread and it took 40 minutes to serve The worst part was that when we raised complaint to the restaurant manager he didn't even apologized and told cashier to give us 10% discount like our attempt was to get discount after having such bad food: 5.25897586815774, Wait Wait, the most hilarious part is to come - bill arrived and the guy told us that since we are paying by American express card so he will remove the discount by manager as with Amex we are getting 20% discount and two offers can't be clubbed My advise is to eat at CP roadside

that food was on the way, we waited, smiled, waved and then a fellow in tired a Red Shirt came to tell us that we had not ordered any more food.: 2.691583284284873, Red to me is energy, but it seemed wrong on them.: 0.05414949970570924, Then RED argued, insisted, argued, stated again, told use we were wrong and no order was placed.: 0.4773396115361977, There was no remorse and by then, I had enough, so I requested for the check.: 0.07180694526191878, Only then a small whimper, tiny wee bit of a meeky suggestion was made that if we waited ( and yes...more more wait ), he could possible get

just the poor quality of food, appalling levels of service, huge delays, missing standards of guest experience, food, taste, temperature, service quality, but the indifferent attitude of the Manager and possibly ...maybe the colour RED !!: 4.001765744555621, Even a non-descript, Highway Dhaba, will not want to own this experience.: 0.42083578575632724, This DHABA is a Recipe for RED DISASTER.:

0.3625662154208358, To a horrifying dismay, not only did the food lack taste, the quality of the produce was worse.: 1.3725721012360208, Even the service was very sad with all the servers just lurking around the tables.  : 0.5679811653914068, For started I ordered the Veg Galouti Kabab which was average.: 0.43084167157151265, Probably the only decent thing in the meal Main Course Review: Paneer chili - This dish was very poorly prepared and the paneer (cottage cheese) was of stale quality.: 0.6586227192466156, It tasted like coconut: 0.0994702766333137, so I sent the dish back Pudina Paratha: It was stinking of oil/ghee, the result of using uncleaned utensils.: 0.20188346085932896, Very bad aftertaste Veg Tawa Pulao -: 0.2113007651559741, This diet also tasted bad and was

and food one gets in there, I decided to take a chance and see if the situation is at all that bad.: 1.9211300765155976, On the fateful day we arrived at Dabha, there was no place to sit inside hence we decided to sit outside, of course we visited during lunch but then it was pleasant outside as well and we had water sprinklers too to cool the temperature.: 1.2065921130076516, Firstly, no one came to take our order for at least 15 minutes (imagine you go out on a lunch during business hours and then you don't even get entertained, how unwelcoming is that).: 0.6621542083578578, I waived at the manager who was standing right next to the glass door, but he royally ignored me/ us (perhaps serving or ensuring everything is going on fine may not be a part of his job).: 0.5303119482048264, Secondly, when the server came to us, we ordered whatever we wanted together (drinks, starters, main course and dessert), as we'd already anticipated what sort of mess we had gotten ourselves into.: 0.8969982342554443, We explicitly mentioned to the server that we would like to have starters and drinks together followed by main course and dessert (even though its obvious for a service professional to not to bring everything together: 0.9158328428487346, but then you know what we were dealing with - a place where common sense was almost non existent).: 0.7233666862860506, Not to our surprise, our starters and main course were served together (Of course, we had to eat both the courses: 0.6297822248381402, so why waste time in serving main course after starters eventually everything needs to be eaten so why waste time in following the courses - this is the mantra of servers).: 0.9811653914067098, Thirdly, Drinks, they were just not served to us.: 0.2348440258975868, The server just forgot to get them.: 0.07357268981753973, I asked the server of the adjoining table to get the drinks, he did not even to come to my table and just ran away.: 1.0782813419658623, Fourthly, the frequency at which server visited our table was so quick that it almost felt like a life time (except for the time when he got us our bill - at least a point where this place wins brownie points).: 1.9699823425544436, Fifthly, and the most astonishing aspect of poor service experienced by me was when one of my colleagues ordered water at the end of the meal, only one glass of water was served.: 1.4967628016480279, When I confronted the server why only one glass, \"Don't you see six people sitting on the table and its the end of the meal, everyone would have water?\":

one of them that it was my birthday too.: 0.4249558563861095, They completely ignored us and proceeded to wish birthday greetings to other guests with bigger gathering.: 0.14184814596821663, It was such a let down to a very special dinner.  : 0.22248381400824013, This earns them my first terrible rating on tripadvisor.: 0.10653325485579754, Would never visit them again.: 0.1418481459682166, It was my birthday and since i have been visiting this restaurant very often my wife planned to go for my birthday dinner here only.: 0.836962919364332, After reaching there we had to wait for good 10/minutes as the hostess was not there on her desk,later we were given table to sit.: 0.9676280164802824, We ordered food my wife told them that its my birthday: 1.4997057092407298, and if they can

The food was not only cold but Karim showing itself to be one of the top restaurants in Asia refuse to serve even the basic onion!!!  : 1.3425544437904646, It seems that the onion prices have taken the shine out of Karim's name  The tandoori roti was having hair on top of it which the waiter very conveniently removed by hand but when i objected he changed it The raddish served in place of onion is the cheapest available in the market I found other customers also complaining at the cash counter People should inquire before visiting this place The food was really bad .: 3.1630370806356676, The

sharing platter and whilst I fully appreciate the cheese is probably expensive for them to buy in - 4 crackers on a sharing cheese board is just poor.: 0.29546792230723956, Take your money and custom elsewhere.  : 0.11889346674514421, Location wise it’s great: 0.088875809299588, but you’ll be bitten to death by mosquitos while you eat.: 0.11948204826368453, You’ll also find that after 3pm you can’t sit in the tented seating areas out the front (despite when we went and left there being lots of other people sat there)  the ambience was great but the food was pathetic .: 1.8552089464390817,

Paid over 2100 for a simple emal for 2 and they refuse a amex coz: 0.0329605650382578, it's a little higher commissions ,  It's sad when restaurants who charge a lot refuse to be customer friendly , If it was a street joint or a Udipi charging me 200 for a meal, I'd say ok Not when paying 2000 plus Had a 3-course dinner composed of a small tomato soup, the main dish was penne with roast lamb and a bowl of fresh fruit for desert.: 1.2748675691583287, The roast lamb it wasnt - basically tiny cubes of lamb mixed in the pasta - probably in a cheese sauce, didnt taste like much of anything.: 0.37728075338434375, I expected some well roasted piece of lamb - no such luck.: 0.09064155385520896, The bowl of sliced fruit was more like what I would expect at a breakfast table in a 2-star

and not wanting to take a chance on a Saturday evening, I called Param at the restaurant and booked a table for 8 pm.: 1.0688640376692173, Param informed me that they did not hold a table for over ten minutes beyond the booked time.: 0.7698646262507357, Fair enough.: 0.0005885815185403178, We reached on time and spotted an empty table with chairs around it - ideal for beer drinkers like us who could easily leave the table to visit the washroom from time to time.: 1.7569158328428487, We were told that that particular table was already booked and were instead led to a table one end of which was pushed against a wall.: 0.8646262507357267, The table had a long bench seating which meant that every time someone wanted to visit the washroom, everybody else sitting in that row had to get up to allow the people sitting towards the inside to get out.: 1.1277221895232488, Moreover, this table was actually good for four but with six of us sitting, space was cramped, with elbows hitting elbows.: 0.6827545615067686, Adding to the distress was poor air conditioning and raucous noise across the restaurant which made peaceful dining impossible.: 0.7457327839905826, And the empty table we had requested for?: 0.3431430253090053, It remained empty till 9.48 pm - almost two hours.: 0.055915244261330196, So much for holding a table for 10 minutes after its booking time!!: 0.7363154796939375, A

guests leaving them standing The foods was served 45 min after ordering  I ordered with special instructions for food without onions but nobody cared Further the waiters serving the good had no clue as to what they were serving Non veg food was served to vegetarians telling them it's a veg dish  Further more the staff had no regrets as to the kind of service they were offering or ye mistakes they had  Overall pathetic service , they spiked ye whole occasion  It used to be decent till about 2-3 years back but now that they have commercialized and started with new branches, the food aspect has taken a nosedive.: 6.9511477339611565, You can have much, much better qorma and nihari right next to Karim's at Al Jawahar.: 0.15832842848734546, I am never going back to Karim's again.:

ripped off by so many kinds of tax that Lodi- the Garden Restaurant levied us.: 0.21365509123013537, We had: 1 bottle of Perrier(750m) 2 glasses of King Fisher 2 glasses of red wine 1 french fries as a side order 1 plate of pasta 1 plate of risotto A light dinner as we didn't have a big appetite.: 0.6368452030606239, The receipt says: 1 x PERRIER & SERVICES: 325.00 2 x KING FISHER SERVICE: 390.00

that the menu said RS.190 for a perrier which became Rs390.: 0.3172454384932312, So I guess the other items were also charged more expensive than what we saw on the menu.: 0.3572689817539729, And then they charged us 5 different taxes!: 0.10947616244849913, The receipt says: Net Amount: 2,400 VAT@20.0: 261.00 SVC@10.0: 240.00 ST1@3.09: 81.58 VAT@ 12.5: 136.89 VTC@0.00: 10.00 Total: 3,129.00 Do I have to pay service fee for a bottle of water with service fee???: 1.1442024720423778, Anyway it's true that in India there are usually 2-3 taxes you get charged at the restaurant but I don't understand what all the extras mean.: 0.7616244849911713, Beside, as you have noticed, their tax calculation is odd.: 0.04473219540906415, Anything multiplied by 0 becomes 0: 0.0005885815185403178, When we realised all this at the hotel, all of our good memories at the restaurant had gone away.: 1.0176574455562095, I wanted to go back there to complain but I didn't because I didn't want to ruin my trip any longer.: 0.1977633902295468, Overall, it can be said that this restaurant is only good for people who want to throw away their money or people who can eat with their company paying their bill.: 1.864626250735727, having a good meal is about the experience.: 0.7733961153619776, and when the restaurant owners and staff treat you like the lamb they tie outside on the street you get the feeling of not only being ignored but downright insulted.: 1.014714537963508, a person goes to have a good meal and a good time.: 1.0912301353737492, however when you are treated like you have come to get free food even though the menu states that the food is overpriced and the experience later says that the food is not superb as claimed and advertised but something that you might find elsewhere...: 3.7180694526191873, it's average...honestly....: 0.10241318422601531, so why bother battling the heat and dust of old delhi and jostle your way through small roads with rikshaw walas

lost down a narrow alleyway in the Jama Masjid neighborhood while looking for Karim's, and that was for us the best part of this experience.: 0.55562095350206, Karim's is at best a greasy spoon, and despite the accolades pasted about the walls and on the grimy menus, I must rank it last in terms of all Indian food I've ever been served.  : 1.4226015303119481, The food was unbelievably greasy (they bring a special dish simply to hold the poured-off grease from the food) and my stomach was rumbling unhappily before I even paid the bill.: 2.4384932313125365, Unhappily, there was nothing notable to me about the smell or taste of the food- just lots of greasiness.: 0.1912889935256033, And when I ordered a coke, I was brought a watered-down, uncarbonated liquid in a paper cup-:

everything) the feeling of being essentially mugged at one of their restaurants leaves a very bad taste in the mouth.: 0.5821071218363744, Staying in beautiful and favourite The Leela Palace Hotel, tryed Megu as expert of japanese cousine and having been in all best japanese reaturants all over the world.: 0.19658622719246616, Well surprisingly enough, and in few words, not only the service has

rating this restaurant has on here is deceptive, and can lead people to spend their precious money on sub-par food, ambiance and service.: 2.7139493819894054, The Ambiance: TACKY green carpet from the 60s still dominates the overall look of this restaurant.: 0.6521483225426722, The woodwork on the walls and ceilings too was depressing.: 0.008828722778104767, Their silverware, vases and other dining

Service:: 0.0594467333725721, This really was the rotten icing on our burnt cake.: 0.049440847557386695, We were seated in a comfortable corner spot, which was great, but the waiter served us water and then took over 17 minutes to return to take our order.: 1.0794585050029428, Perhaps it was the corner location which was hard to spot, but when one pays the price that this restaurant demands, one would expect waiters to be trained to be more attentive.: 0.8028251912889935, \\ Overall, I would not recommend this place.: 0.6291936433195997, There are several other Chinese and pan-Asian restaurants that would give you your money's worth and actually provide edible food.: 1.3113596233078282, Bottle of oil is what you get in the name of Chinese food.: 1.0700412007062978, Even street

0.37139493819894054, After a beautiful Sunday afternoon spent with my b-school friends at a reunion, which was at the same mall, we went to chilis for a late lunch.: 0.4161271336080047, The place itself is small though cozy and were promptly seated.: 0.6468510888758093, The three of us placed our orders (Honey Basa, Chicken Fajita and some sandwich).: 0.10771041789287816, Well the presentation of the food was quite pleasing though the taste was average.: 1.2713360800470865, However, what came after was the killer.: 0.18540317834020012, No sooner did we leave (btw they dont clear the table before getting the check) this place, I was miserable feeling queasy and spent the next four hours throwing up, the experience was horrible.: 1.4008240141259565, So if you do have a death wish, please go ahead and eat at chili's.: 0.13596233078281342, Recall going to this Taj hotel chain property and the Ming Resturant over the years fondly.: 0.27545615067686874, Used to be an iconic place.:

disappointing evening.: 0.1547969393761036, The Resturant gave no consideration for the Amex Centurion booking; had to be reminded.: 0.09005297233666862, No one stopped by for the special evening.  : 0.12065921130076515, There was Zero ambience.: 0.05650382577987051, Food mediocre.: 0.11948204826368451, And regrettably Service was also poor.  : 0.16421424367274867, The shrimp dim sum starter finally showed up with tail attached ( which is normal ), but with little eyes drawn on the dim sum... which could be cute if we did not have to cut these off to eat it.: 0.2560329605650382, Made for an uneasy feeling!  : 0.022954679223072393, The Jumbo prawn meat cam in on the tough side.: 0.05532666274278987, The signature dish, Crispy spinach, was very oily and had to be sent back to be strained.: 0.16833431430253093, Rest of the food was just ok, not great To top it all, shared our meal with flies buzzing around our food.: 2.272513243084167, Then we had a few mosquitoes show up and sit on the table cloth, serving dishes.: 0.5344320188346086, (Despite telling our server a few times to fix it, get a swatter etc, was simply told instead that , they will contact pest control), they were totally indifferent.: 0.3325485579752795, Now having travelled the world & within India for many decades, we do understand that insects, flies, mosquitoes etc., are par for course in a lot of places.: 0.40494408475573873, However when we are paying super premium prices, we expect some value for what is paid for.: 0.18716892289582107, What we got here instead was totally unacceptable for a supposedly five star, premium 5Star indoor Resturant, rated as fine dining by Amex.: 0.3137139493819894, And for the first time that I can recall, left ZERO as a tip on a meal.: 0.5138316656856974, And ZERO as a rating.  : 0.025897586815773983, Life is too precious to waste eating poorly prepared and over priced food, indifferently served.  : 1.3972925250147143, We will not be going back any time soon Very unimpressive food, mediocre restaurant!: 1.9346674514420246, The decor reminded me of a three star bland breakfast room...: 0.1542083578575633, No ambience!: 0.05709240729841083, They charge extortionate prices for average food.: 1.2195409064155385, I have eaten in some of the best restaurants around the world and this certainly was not even close to the mark.: 0.21247792819305472,

0.02707474985285462, Cannot comment on the food.: 1.0082401412595645, After patiently waiting for a table when finally a table was available , the manager Upasit decided to give the table to a foreigner family that walked in just then.: 1.4473219540906415, On raising an objection to this discrimination, I was told that his duty was to get business for the restaurant and that he would try and get us a place too.: 1.3672748675691584, I was quite shocked and angry with this behavior considering that I am a very widely travelled person in India and abroad and for some time I did not know how to react.: 0.5591524426133019, Certainly reprehensible behaviour !!: 0.02472042377869335, Encouraged by the waiter I decided to start with some \"Chicken Wings\", however, we ordered boneless chicken wings which were not really chicken wings but were breaded boneless pieces of fried \"KFC\" type chicken, surely not \"Chicken Wings\".: 1.3619776339022955, The waiter was kind enough to replace our \"Chicken Wings\" with traditional Barbecue sauce covered \"Chicken Wings\" with bones.: 0.37610359034726315, It came with a sour, creamy and punchy sauce that reminded me of a friend who moved to America and went to a posh Mexican restaurant for the first time and we served something unexpectedly delicious.  : 1.5826957033549145, I went to the restaurant with my partner and I think we could have used more steering on the menu because instead of straight starters and mains, we capered about and didn't order quite enough to start with.: 1.2648616833431432, The photos of the food on the menu confused us completely.: 1.170688640376692, The portion size was huge and we had to takeaway most of the food.: 1.0529723366686286, \"The Monterey Chicken\" and \"Shrimp Salad\" were two delightful dishes, chunky and chewy, with a subtle flick of chilli but tasting more of itself than anything else.: 0.2001177163037081, We then had the Mashed Potatoes and beans, which were curious little dishes, they seem simple but any lumps may ruin the smooth texture of a perfectly good mash, the portion size was too small to realistically share, even though with a bit of huffing and puffing I did divide them into two equal halves for me and my partner to share.: 0.6609770453207772, The \"Salmon\" was not the best thing, it was kind of dry but slick, slightly briny and at the same time unctuous in an unpleasant way.: 0.5303119482048263, I loved all the dressings that came with my salad and chicken but found them pretty similar to each other; every dish had the same sour cream dressing, however, i guess all those squishy, fatty sauces do taste similar, if not taste the same and convey the same mouth-feel and overall experience.: 1.3678634490876984, I would like to rate this place 4/5 for its customer service and 3/5 for its food.: 2.1135962330782814, FINAL RATING 1/5, only because this place is RAT infested.: 0.5503237198351971, When I go out to a restaurant I want to have a fun evening: 0.7198351971748088, and I can only say that I've had a fun evening when the restaurant I'm eating at delivers exactly what I am looking for and that includes: Great Tasting Food Chili's surely has really great food and even though it reminds me of TGI Friday, I still always have a great time here because it's food is just as tasty as TGI's food.: 4.340200117716304, The \"Chicken Wings\" and the \"Paneer Bites\" were both very delicious but the only issue is that all their starters and main courses seem to come with the same dip.  : 0.33608004708652145, Sufficient Quantity  : 0.002354326074161271, The food might be absolutely delectable but if the portions are pretentiously tiny then I can never feel satisfied and Chili's passed the quantity test 100% as the portions were quite big!: 1.1871689228958209, Courteous Staff I can never stand grumpy people around me and if you are eating at a restaurant you surely do not want to be served by someone with an attitude like most restaurants, \"Dimsum Bros\", for example.: 1.331371394938199, The staff was great, friendly and smiley!: 0.3943496174220129, Comfortable Seating and an Intriguing Ambience  Quite comfortable and fun: 0.04061212477928193, , it is perfect for having a great night out with friends!  : 0.2731018246027075, FINAL RATING 1/5, only because this place is RAT infested.: 0.5503237198351971, Machan at the Taj New Delhi...: 0.18187168922895822, Once the pride of Delhi....has fallen so low in standards, that it's not surprising it's shocking....went on Dec 12'th night post partying at Ricks with friends.....zero service with attitude & arrogance....pathetic food...the star dish \"Bulls Eye\" was not even palatable...the sponge was hard as stone & the ice cream was with ice crystals....when we demanded to see the manager none came, we requested to see the chef.....the staff brought some junior kitchen aide pretending to be chef.......I seriously hope somebody at the Taj Group reads this & do something about it......: 3.318422601530313, Hoping to visit our most favourite place someday again.....: 0.7004120070629782, Amen...: 0.0005885815185403178, We live in

0.2448499117127722, but even they were disappointed with the food.: 1.064743967039435, We ordered Hot & Sour soup (pathetic, full if black pepper), Prawns, Fish, vegetables, 2 noodles, 2 fried rice...we even asked the waiter to recommend the fish.: 1.0423778693349028, It was really really bad.: 0.1983519717480871, We couldn't believe this was the standard of food being served at a Taj Hotel.: 1.3101824602707475, The most disappointing about this was it ruined a very special family occassion.: 0.20306062389640966, Food - very bad taste service- very slow unorganized sitting arrangement  Never order non-veg soups.: 0.8522660388463802, they are disgusting.: 0.020011771630370805, issue with Cleanliness and unhygienic.: 0.030017657445556206, We went for lunch and ordered food for three people - veg kebabs, a chickpeas snack, naan, yellow dal, a paneer dish and a chicken masala.: 2.1989405532666275, Every single dish was bland, tasteless and devoid of any flavour whatsoever.: 0.27310182460270743, Its a wonder how such basic food can be prepared so badly.: 1.0594467333725721, It wasn't just average, this was a truly awful meal.: 0.2542672160094173, The most expensive, bad food i've eaten.: 1.2872277810476749, Cannot understand how any restaurant can offer such food to its guests.: 1.6921718658034137, Hi guys, me and my family went to Machan, Taj Hotel on

manager (Aditya) that we are here for my parent's anniversary and the manager who seemed quite new totally ignored this.: 0.642731018246027, Anyway, the waiter (Mr. Binojee) serving us.. dropped our wine on the table and then dropped a fork on my moms foot.: 0.6115361977633902, I had ordered a veggie burger..: 0.2848734549735138, I am sorry to say it was really pathetic and on top of that they served it with absolutely cold fries.. because I didn't want to spoil the occasion I ate as much of it as I could.: 0.5927015891701001, After we were done with our food, we asked for the manager and

30 minutes later, we would have left but he wasn't bringing the cheque either!: 0.6280164802825192, The worst part is, they charged us for the burger and the next day I fell so ill, I had a bad case

without eating.: 0.657445556209535, We had to keep telling them over and over no just give us the bill; finally they brought it.: 0.21836374337845793, Overall, waiting that amount of time, plus the fact that they forgot my dish and then were trying to guilt trip me about eating it left me quite unhappy.: 0.7628016480282519, A suggestion to make would be listen to the customer- with their order and also if they’re requesting the bill.: 0.38434373160682755, I probably wouldn’t go there again as the entire experience took a totally different turn to what I was expecting, on what was supposed

0.7510300176574456, We said, we will order in a while but in next 5 min again they asked for order.: 0.762801648028252, It means you can't think for settle up for 10min there.: 0.08769864626250735, Set up was not really wonderful, not very attractive, rooftop is restaurant but the stairs are so so thin, a healthy or fat person can't go upstairs.: 0.6433195997645673, Maybe food is looking great, lassi can imagine sweet by you and peanut butter, chocolate shake attract you but frankly speaking this is not worth for money, not very tasty, maybe I will think 100 times before eating and drinking there.  : 1.6568569746909942, We had lunch here and it's in a lovely setting.: 0.09064155385520893, Having said that, we thought the food was terrible.: 1.2595644496762801, I think it exists for

have plenty foot traffic to serve (may be not right word, since they do little of that) - but hope that they can realize the potential of what they have and build on it - or Set'z will soon Jet Set

15 was booked well in advance: 0.43555032371983515, and i see no reason why the restaurant could not have been well prepared especially after having been well informed of our visit and the special occasion associated with it (birthday) .  : 0.918775750441436, The manager - a Mr Praveen Singh is probably one of the most impolite, rude and of indifferent character that I have ever come across in

table in their open terrace since the weather was just perfect , however the table was covered with a thick layer of dust which was obviously not cleaned before the cutlery was laid out, on complaining to the manager about the same he of course came up with the lame excuse of it being outdoors, well i could have bought that excuse had it not been for a thick layer of dust, however he didn’t even offer to have it cleaned up , rather we had to eat our entire meal ( a good 2.5 hours) in that thick layer of dust!: 1.9217186580341377, The drinks once ordered came at their own will, few of them even delayed by as much as 20 mins upon arrival of the first one..to top it all the waiters didnt recall who had ordered which drink with them being served at random to the guests.:

they cannot cater to large groups!: 0.7227781047675103, I do wish they appoint basic educated and 'hospitable' staff who have actually undergone some level of professional hospitality training with an immediate change of their manager cause I do see potential in this place.: 1.2060035314891113, My son and I were visiting Delhi on the 16th.of Feb.and decided to try out this much talked about

casually asked whether we had a reservation.: 0.2483814008240141, Our entry could have have been barred due to many reasons one of which could be that there were no tables vacant.: 0.08828722778104767, However this line of argument is not convincing because the dining hall looked empty except may be for some loitering staff members.: 0.43555032371983526, I returned to read reviews about this place and noted that only one reviewer had mentioned in passing about rumors that the restaurant could be snooty and choosy about who they admitted .: 1.2213066509711594, Eventually the reviewer did say the restaurant was good in an attempt to dispel this rumor.: 0.8934667451442025, I give one star for this because a restaurant that does not admit me is no good and terrible as far as I am concerned.  : 1.0182460270747498, Since no one has recorded in any review about being turned away I am putting my experience on record for the benefit of those who are toying with the idea

have gone to its head.: 0.5497351383166569, Eternally crowded, the one time that we did manage to find the place almost empty the waiter first tried to force us to sit on a tiny table next to two other people..when I pointed out that there were several larger tables free, he actually said that while we are free to sit there..: 1.9223072395526783, he will make us get up in the middle of our meal if a bigger party comes along...: 0.19011183048852268, I have never in all my time in Delhi heard of such a thing...they seem to be more concerned about getting as many people in..rather than about providing quality service...: 1.3390229546792232, the food is definitely not worth this....: 1.0559152442613302, I had already made a reservation at this place.: 0.5809299587992937, I told the

rated reviews and thought of visiting here, visited few days back, waited for around 25 minutes outside on the road, the place was stinking near the entrance, inside was more horrible, small, unhygienic place, very congested place with small tables, waiter was wiping tables and throwing all the food under the table only (just imagine), food is costly and not worth at all, ordered butter chicken (got cold chicken in luke warm gravy) could not even eat few bites (and rest I gave to the street dogs): 7.343731606827546, I told them to pack the remaining stuff, the waiter brought 2 small non food grade polythene bags and started packing food on the edge of the table and it was above to fall on my cloths.: 2.8440258975868153, I will not recommend this place to anyone, but still if you want to waste your money and time, it is up to you guys :) Visited the restaurant today for breakfast today.: 1.8175397292525015, the table was given to us only when we told the staff that the table was vaccant.: 1.1306650971159504, there was bright sun and there was a garden umbrella but even after asking the restaurant staff 5 times they did not errevt it.: 0.9788110653325486, took 15 minutes

ended up here for that reason.: 0.08416715715126545, We were shown to a table for 4 a few minutes later...and as we saw a 2 seater empty, we offered to shift so that some other people could also come

starting setting up our table with a new bottle even before we had paid up.: 0.4249558563861095, Anyway, we started with a plate of 'vada-pao' and a plate of 'dal-bati',,,and stopped after that.: 0.16303708063566805, The taste of vada-pao was just chillis; the dal of the was bland with no Rajasthani flavour, the bati tasted dry with no ghee and no stuffing.: 0.34726309593878746, The waiters very very flustered and unable to serve properly.: 0.1818716892289582, It was a horrible experience, i went there for a date..: 0.5273690406121248, and they spoiled it.: 0.008828722778104767, My

1.0494408475573866, But i am trying to mitigate my mistake by posting a review so that people get to know .: 0.3790464979399647, i have taken few pictures of the meal and you can see the insect in that.: 0.16303708063566805, And if anyone know how to teach lesson to such adamant restaurant companies do help me.: 0.690994702766333, kake da dhaba has lost its charm now.....the place was utterly hygienic and seating was cramped....the food used to taste great earlier but i went after a few years and a lot has changed since....will never go there again....: 2.1865803413772804, This place is essentially a desi dhaba in the middle of city charging far more money then the food here deserves.. neither the quantity or quality of their \"per plate\" system justified the price tag and frankly the owners should understand that this is not the age when \"pure desi ghee\" can be the one and only USP ingredient.: 2.085932901706886, This place serves Breakfast as well as dinner buffet .: 0.7563272513243083, Breakfast buffet is normally included with the room and I want to clarify that breakfast buffet is probably 5*.: 0.2689817539729253, This review is for dinner buffet .:

1.1530311948204828, Naturally the food is not fresh.: 1.0347263095938788, Many times you can see a discolored layer on top of the food trays .: 1.0841671571512654, I also found that the cuisine is confused .: 0.07710417892878163, They label it international with Indian, Asian and International varieties .: 0.11006474396703944, However the truth is that thier preparations are not upto the mark.: 0.03649205414949971, In thier efforts to play to multiple audiences,the preparations lose direction.: 0.0329605650382578, Another issue - Way too salty food.: 1.0323719835197176, I believe 90 percent of the population will refuse to eat some of the preparations because of the salt content.: 0.1748087110064744, It is that salty.: 0.01059446733372572, The staff is normally tired by evening and service is inconsistent.: 0.8257798705120659, Sometimes you are served ok: 0.2654502648616833, and sometimes you are just ignored .: 0.0164802825191289, Some of the staff do need proper orientation as they have a tendency to ignore local or anyone who looks like local people, something which will be totally unacceptable in many cultures.: 0.6533254855797527, And it is definitely not cheap.: 0.02118893466745144, For Rs 2000 per person, you really have multiple options and very decent food around.: 1.1494997057092406, They do need to do something about the dinner buffet or just close it if they can not manage .  : 0.28251912889935255, It was a disappointing experience .: 0.3231312536786345, After a long Friday shift, I decided to go here for brunch buffet with a friend on February 14, 2015.: 0.25603296056503827, We waited about an hour to get a table.: 0.38493231312536785, Trust me guys, pathetic food, literally cold and left out food (I mean 2 pieces in a box).: 2.369040612124779,

something out of routine- \"Kaka Dhaba in Connaught Place\", which use to be my parents favourite 20 years back :) Result- DISAPPOINTMENT !!!: 0.4267216009417304, I never expect fine dining standards in a place like this however basic hygiene is something I cannot ignore and kaka was no exception to my rule, it's one of the filthiest joints (would not even give it a status of Dhaba): 0.8004708652148323, Don't know why people still beeline for this place as the food too was below average.: 1.924072984108299, We had Keema egg (it had mutton tounge in it!!!): 0.031194820482636845, and Chicken Curry (was sweet and just a different looking butter chicken gravy, meat tasted boiled not tandoor).: 0.5679811653914066, ADVICE-- if ever feel like challenging your routine lifestyle, try either Karim\"s or Rajendra Dhaba.: 0.1724543849323131, I still love those places.: 0.06062389640965274, I have been to the restauarant twice.: 0.0005885815185403178, There is so much tax on the food that it becomes amazingly expensive.: 1.080047086521483, It is cheaper to eat lunch in a 5star in Gurgaon.: 0.2007062978222484, There are much better places with  better prices.: 0.3078281341965862, Having grown up in the states, i am always excited about visiting these american themed places as sometimes they are good enough to satisfy my nostalgia.: 0.41200706297822254, so when i read all the good reviews about this place, i was quite looking forward to it.: 0.9723366686286051, the place looked quite good on entering, so i was even happier.: 0.9199529134785168, and the menu at first glance looked okay.: 0.23366686286050614, nothing superlative.: 0.0011771630370806356, thus rounding off the diner theme.: 0.015303119482048263, so, feeling quite happy, i ordered.: 0.316656856974691, unfortunately there was where the good times ended.  : 0.4114184814596822, if a diner takes almost 30 minutes to deliver food, i am pretty sure its gonna sink without a trace stateside.: 1.2242495585638613, so anyways, after that the first dish arrived.: 0.1812831077104179, as i had been expecting normal diner sized portions, imagine my surprise when it was a piddly little dish with altogether tiny portions.: 0.29782224838140087, couple of small sausages, bland, salt less eggs, a few pieces of bacon, not rashers, and dense pancakes. looked across at my girlfriend's plate of baked hash brown and there was nothing crisp to be seen.: 0.35432607416127126, just a bed of mashed potatoes with some corn and melted cheese on top.: 0.04532077692760447, and again without any trace of salt.  : 0.025897586815773983, after some more time, my crepes arrived.: 0.31901118304885223, couldn't see them on the plate but i took a bite of the dish and found something floury and raw in my mouth.: 0.3943496174220129, which on further deduction revealed itself to be the crepe.: 0.003531489111241907, now, i don't know what that was exactly but that plate of crepes was unlike any i have ever had.: 0.1483225426721601, serve them to a frenchman and he would try to kill the chef.: 0.2271924661565627, and the service.: 0.457327839905827, having to keep reminding the waiter to bring water is not good service.: 1.0959387875220719, add that to the super long delay and the general rude demeanour (which i initially took as normal diner waiter behaviour): 0.46027074749852853, i was in every mood to not tip.: 0.02942907592701589, but ofcourse, they already added a service charge.: 0.5526780459093584, just salt on the wounds.: 0.02472042377869335, nice.  : 0.07298410829899941, so, in summation, a place that is best avoided.: 0.5991759858740435, its inordinately expensive and in no way justifies those prices.: 0.16597998822836965, diners don't cost almost 30$ to have a completely unsatisfactory and non filling breakfast.: 0.10476751030017657, and the waiters think they are doing you a favor by serving you.: 0.21542083578575633, the amount you would spend in this place would see you having an all american breakfast at home 5 days atleast.: 0.7168922895821072, and it would atleast be edible.: 0.01824602707474985, and a curse on all the ones who said those pancakes were

looking over which was really uncomfortable and then halfway through my meal our server brought the desserts menu over even though I wasn't finished (which he could clearly see...facing me and all), I said I wasn't finished and he said keep it for after.: 1.1842260153031197, Not acceptable when service charge is already levied on the bill...: 0.6986462625073573, he didn't deserve a single rupee.:

first half an hour.: 0.6621542083578574, It was Chaos as they were not able to manage tge number of guests in the restaurant.: 0.672160094173043, 2) Pathetic Food : When they got the starter; We made the biggest mistake of our life by telling them that's it should be less spicy because of what we experienced later.: 0.40258975868157737, We got starters which was completely bland and bad in taste.:

have had a worst dining than here at Elan !: 0.1753972925250147, Starting from giving menu to taking order and finally getting the food everything took a lot of time because they had only 2 people to serve or take orders and out of those 2 people one was a manager was totally useless and not worth being at a so called 5 star !: 2.7398469688051788, We ordered onions and it took them approx 30 minutes to get it !: 0.5414949970570924, Best part was they served us our ordered vegetables and the remaining they kept it not at our table but at some distance from us in some tray !: 0.8864037669217184, When we wanted second helping ie vegetables which was left , we failed to have it as there was no one to serve our ordered vegetables !: 0.616833431430253, Then we called manager was as earlier said was totally useless as he was laughing instead of bein sorry for extreme poor servise !: 0.5532666274278988, My friend and I ate at Yum Yum Cha’s khan market outlet last month and she fell violently unwell on the meat she ate.: 0.21836374337845788, Fortunately or unfortunately I ate vegetarian food, so I didn’t feel sick that evening.  : 1.190700412007063, So, that brings me to the question: is that particular outlet hygienic?: 0.0429664508534432, This has never happened at their Saket outlet.: 0.06003531489111241, In fact, that looks amply clean.: 0.07357268981753973, Does the cold chain break at any place in the non vegetarian food transportation or does the chef not know how to prepare the fish?: 1.9258387286639198, A dumbstruck manager called me up only to inform me that 250 other people ate there that night and that they never received any other phone calls of people falling ill.: 0.7645673925838727, Logic: 100/10  : 0.0011771630370806356, But he did promise to speak to the chef and call me back..: 0.06121247792819305, Still waiting yougaiz!: 0.07533843437316068, They need to change the colour of their cutlery to white.: 0.12948793407886994, Sadly Black cutlery kills the appetite and the black pot the dish came in had chipped and fallen into the tofu curry itself.  : 0.41377280753384343, Had a terrible experience at the restaurant.: 0.9387875220718069, The food is great but they need to invest in proper serving pots and plates.  : 1.25897586815774, I used to love their food till this happened with me  Decent food but Pathetic Service, really really delayed service, many things out of stock in the menu.: 2.7981165391406706, Overall a very bad experience !!!: 0.47733961153619775, The evening starts with the smooth lie that I guess the staff are trained to trot out in most over-priced restaurants about how to handle a couple who don’t look like RADs (Rich Arrogant Delhi-ites) –i.e. treat them like dirt.: 0.8363743378457915, So having booked a table when TW (The Wife) and I walk in a few minutes early, we are first escorted to a 16 or so seater table where at one end a group of Japanese were boisterously banzai-ing the bejesus out of bottles of beer and the other end was populated by two garrulous and querulous families with two empty chairs dividing them.: 1.078281341965862, The steward half bowed and grandly gestured at the empty chairs as if to say “look what I saved just for you”!: 0.09770453207769277, We looked around and saw a totally empty 10 seater and asked to be seated there.: 0.33372572101236025, The steward reluctantly offered two chairs right next to the wall –i.e. with the least air-conditioning and ventilation.: 0.0994702766333137, When TW asked why we can’t have two chairs at the other end of the table pat came the smooth lie – because the rest of the table was booked for a party of eight (of course the fact that whichever end we sat the party of 8 could still be accommodated was irrelevant because we weren’t RADs).: 1.3543260741612713, And of course when a few minutes later four people (and NOT the ‘party of 8’) walked in and proprietarily sat at the head of the table there was nothing but obsequious bowing and scraping from the serving staff The menu has about a hundred dishes and ten of them have something that looks either like a tweezer or a lateral V made out of two tiny jharoo sticks signifying that they are the restaurant’s signature dishes.: 2.1677457327839904, Having read the almost uniformly ecstatic reviews about the food we ordered TK’s signature Raw Papaya Salad with Shrimp.: 1.3543260741612713, A few minutes later a po-faced waiter plonked a bowl (without a serving spoon) in front of us announcing tonelessly “papaya salad” presumably just in case we didn’t know what we had ordered.: 0.8087110064743966, The classic papaya salad with shrimp consists of light green crunchy flat noodles of papaya and plump medium sized shrimps with contrasting hits of lime, soy and fish sauce and Thai chillies and garnished with peanuts.: 0.22071806945261918, What we got was a bowl of soggy yellow papaya noodles with no peanuts or discernible hits of any lime, soy and fish sauce or chilies.: 0.29134785167745736, Foraging around we finally manged to locate 5 tiny paper thin almost translucent slivers of shrimp.: 0.04061212477928193, The shrimp tempura looked the part but had the crispiness of a wilting lily.: 0.06180105944673337, The ‘imported’ flambéed lamb chops weren’t flambéed – we weren’t RADs after all – but weren’t too bad – but like every dish we ordered this too was served in a bowl with no serving spoon The biggest problem with TK’s is that it is designed for large groups.: 1.0535609181871688, As far as I can tell the restaurant configuration hasn’t changed since they opened quite a few years ago.: 0.672160094173043, Sitting and sweating in notional air-conditioning, I suddenly realized that in the beginning it was the novelty of the format and the culinary cabaret of the chefs that were the main ingredients of taste in their food.: 1.290759270158917, Once you get over that then what you get (or at least what we got) was at best just about average.  : 0.279576221306651, Also they should seriously consider setting aside some area for discrete 2/4 seater tables.  : 0.11359623307828133, Obviously it would also be nice if they stopped treating non-RAD couples like us like dirt, but I guess that’s too much to expect!: 0.266627427898764, We took a few bites of the Dal Makahni & Malai Kofta we'd ordered and left it at that.: 0.5126545026486168, Dal tasted like baked beans, and the kofta had almost no flavour at all.: 0.15126545026486168, HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED.: 0.0017657445556209534, Truth be told, Dal bukhara is the worst dal ever.: 0.33019423190111824, Any dhaba or restaurant in north india makes it better.: 0.7163037080635668, For the best dal, go to Moti Mahal Restaurant which is way below ITC category.: 0.19187757504414363, And its not only about their dal, we ordered 2 more non-veg dishes, they were even worst.: 0.6286050618010594, Taste less food.: 1.0064743967039436, Way too expensive/ over priced.: 0.03590347263095939, ITC Dum-pukht is way way better in terms of taste and value for money.: 0.5515008828722778, Most hyped restaurant in the

were waiting so long for a simple beverage Kindly do not go to this place in a two wheeler.: 1.7192466156562685, The staff right from the parking place starts treating you shabilly totally indicating that you are not welcome.: 0.8864037669217185, Moreover the plates and the glasses are not washed properly.: 0.050618010594467334, I indicated a layer of oil on water in the drinking water but there was no response from the staff.: 0.5585638610947616, I initially told about the water being uncles: 0.2530900529723366, but they themselves told it might be because of unclean glass.: 0.1959976456739258, The staff took 10 minutes to notice this after u raised my voice otherwise the concerned staff was busy chatting on mobile.: 0.9117127722189522, Very bad experience.: 0.47380812242495585, It was a pity that going to Spicy duck with a lot of expectations misfired so badly that after spending so much nothing was passable.: 0.19894055326662743, The famous peking duck was burnt,fried prawns no spice,black pepper chicken was ok,sea bass was stale and smelly,Assorted vegetables full of oil,Noodles were stcky only good was the chilled beer and wine.: 0.8422601530311947, BUT food is a must and the only word was Regret and terrible.: 1.0959387875220716, Everytime I have visited this place, I have always prayed that this time would not be such a horrid affair with Bad Food and the Dirty way Food is served here in this Place.: 1.4620364920541493, They probably will NEVER change and take pride to serve Horrible Food, Served on paper thin, dirty paper plates.: 0.3484402589758682, They started with this Insulting food service style and will end with the same.: 1.5620953502060033, No change, No Innovation.: 0.0394349617422013, Better places use Great quality of disposable Environment friendly plates, cutlery BUT this place is a sorry Horror Story for Food and the way it is served.: 1.2954679223072394, Anyways, this was my last try here.:

longer with table service and home delivery.: 0.9123013537374927, They have acquired arrogance and now tend to treat customers as irritants.: 0.09064155385520893, The Greater Kailash 2 hotel is mostly empty.: 0.09829311359623308, They prefer people who drink; they are uncomfortable with clients who simply want to eat or who are teetotallers as they see them as lower spenders.: 0.46968805179517353, This is a terrible attitude.: 0.13066509711595056, Also, over the year 2012, their food quality has become average and even sub-standard at times.: 1.3778693349028839, The meal we ordered on 24

person who took the order asked us sheepishly whether we wanted with bone or boneless but completely playing on our ignorance that the price was double, the ghee roast chicken did not look roasted from any side and the chettinad chicken tasted very average.: 2.854620364920542, It is because of restaurants like Swagath GK2 that Indians do not go out more often than their south Asian

wait for 20 minutes for our change from the bill demanding we left it as a service tip.: 3.769276044732196, When the 20 minutes came around the man that ”didnt have any change” then took the change

place, we were escorted to a table, where forget any special kind of decoration, they hadn’t even lit up the basic candle lying on every table.  : 1.3060623896409653, Starting with the drinks, if one

mojito only.: 0.02060035314891112, I ordered their virgin pomegranate mojito.: 0.2836962919364332, It looked fancy with nearly a plant of mint placed in the glass but on sipping the same it was the trashiest virgin mojito I have ever tried.: 0.16656856974690992, Extra sweet with no form of pomegranate flavour and of course no form of fizz .: 0.1553855208946439, It’s hard to go much wrong with a mojito but I gave the benefit of doubt and requested the bartender to make a fresh drink and explained the shortcomings.: 0.288993525603296, He got me a second glass which was worse than before.:

wasn’t really happy with the dishes eaten and wanted to go back with one great dish of the place I was trying for the first time.: 1.6127133608004707, He suggested the Mock Prawns.: 0.02413184226015303, It was soya with vegetables in semi cooked tomato sauce served with bread.: 0.4114184814596822, It was edible but again totally dissatisfied with the taste.: 0.1689228958210712, I

interested in their mobile phone then serving their customers.: 0.214832254267216, Food also mediocre.: 0.11948204826368451, This is an updated review since we cannot edit reviews on TripAdvisor, I added a new review post my on-call conversation with the customer care executive from Berco's.  : 0.3007651559741024, Since I love Chinese food, I had decided to go to Berco's for lunch on my birthday.: 1.2330782813419658, Honestly saying, I had the worst experience at Berco's.: 0.42907592701589164, My friend had bought a cake for me as a surprise and asked the staff to serve us after we were done with the meal.: 0.8481459682165979, The waiters had forgotten about it and my friend had to remind them in front of me.: 0.13125367863449086, It was funny because they were openly talking about the surprise cake in front of me.: 0.06238964096527369, My friend had come half an hour early to just arrange these things and avoid any last minute inconvenience and had especially instructed everything to the staff before I arrived.: 0.6792230723955266, So as it was already known that a cake was to arrive, a waiter came with the boxed cake, opened the cake in front of us and stuck the candles on the cake, threw the lighter on the table and walked off.: 0.8334314302530901, Generally, the cake is brought unboxed from the kitchen and with the candles lit.: 0.11536197763390231, Every birthday that I have ever celebrated, whether it's my birthday of my friends', we've always been served an unboxed cake.: 0.39140670982931136, Berco's staff is so incompetent, they don't even know how to serve a cake.: 0.5479693937610359, They should not accept requests in the first place if they cannot even fulfill them properly.: 0.5638610947616244, We could have gone somewhere else.  :

to argue with me that the hair does not belong to any of their staff, instead of immediately changing plates and bringing fresh ones.: 0.5520894643908182, Even after changing the plates, they brought back half of the portion on the plate.: 0.16068275456150677, So basically I paid half the portion for a full price.: 0.15950559152442612, The staff was full of themselves, had no courtesy and did not care to contact even after filling the feedback form.  : 0.3814008240141259, I learned from my experience that Berco's has plenty of customers so they don't consider the inconvenience of one customer because they have plenty to more people to visit their place.  : 1.291347851677457, So after I wrote my review, I was called by Berco's customer care representative Abhinav, who left his contact as an answer to my review to discuss further this issue.: 0.3749264273101825, He explained that apparently, the staff members are outsourced by QBC, whereas the food is from Berco's.: 1.3237198351971746, As a token of apology, he offered a 20% percent discount on my next meal along with free soup and a brownie or something.: 0.28781636256621546, In return, he asked me to either update the review or remove it.: 0.27310182460270743, Ethically people should know about my experience so that they are warned.: 0.5603296056503826, So I found that updating the review will be better because I believe in

nothing bothers me.: 1.337257210123602, But a twenty percent discount will not change the fact that I had a terrible birthday experience.: 0.48381400824014126, It ruined my mood and the whole day ahead.: 0.1088875809299588, Berco's ruined my day.: 0.10300176574455562, In fact, it is in their interests that I will be coming back and paying again.  : 0.10005885815185403, Often if ever I have written a review elsewhere, they have immediately refunded the whole amount and apologized for the matter.: 0.06180105944673338, But here they just want to give bad service and refuse to refund any

0.8157739846968806, Two very arrogant and sniffy \"ladies\" of the staff eventually manned the reception and visibly bored and bothered wrote down the names of the people waiting.: 0.6103590347263095, When doing so, they made it very clear by gestures and impolite behavior, that it would be up to their power to seat the waiting parties for dinner.: 0.2619187757504414, The restaurant was empty but all people were asked to wait despite an very empty reservation book, which I could take a look into.: 1.1230135373749264, 15 minutes later none of the people waiting, including ourselves, was offered a table although the restaurant remained largely empty (only 2 tables were by then occupied).  : 1.3837551500882872, When some people asked the two ladies how long it would still take to get a table,

complained about the non-existent service and were then very unfriendly told to wait longer.: 1.0223660977045321, After I complained, we were finally given a table - in an dark, empty and shabby corner of the restaurant were my wife and I were the only guests.: 1.0894643908181283, It was clearly a part of the restaurant where people were seated who Bukhara doesn't want to serve as guests.: 1.051795173631548, I assume this was because my wife and I were very appropriately dressed for dinner at such place, while others who just walked in, wore flip-flops, dirty jeans and shabby t-shirts.: 0.7998822836962921, It was at this point when we decided to leave and have dinner somewhere else.: 0.2872277810476751, Obviously I cannot rate the food but I do can very well rate the service, and

0.23602118893466745, my only message for the shop owner - swanky name and expensive menu are not the only ingredients to a successful restaurant business  i ussually never write such long reviews but the kind of low quality food this restaurant offers, i am compelled to write such a long review.: 2.8593290170688634, if you are planning to go for dinner or lunch at this restaurant then you need to think twice, the restaurant has very less options for vegetarians add to that the snacks are mostly deep deep fried making them unhealthy to the core moreover they are super spicy making them unedible as well.: 1.6762801648028247, they have deep fried corn which is completely unhealthy as it is deep deep fried hours before.: 0.11653914067098294, then they have mushroom super spicy and unhealthy.: 0.04414361389052383, the thing i love is paneer tikka: 0.1383166568569747, but here you get a very low quality panner tikka with super extra spices added.: 0.2695703354914656, basically the logic behind adding extra spices with most of the restaurants is that it makes the stale food, taste fresh: 1.3696291936433196, but it makes it even more unhealthy to eat.: 0.13301942319011184, i complained to the restaurant manager about food , he simply said , he cant do anything , this is what they have ( such a rude response): 2.020011771630371, i told him i can wait for half an hour atleast bring something for me thats not super spicy, then brought paneer tikka with white sauce that was terrible to taste and felt like vomiting.: 0.8728663919952913, after utter disappointment with the snacks , i headed to the maincourse to find greater disappointment.: 0.13655091230135374, the dal tasted like it has made hours before and stale , tasted pathetic.: 0.33902295467922305, kadai paneer or paneer with gravy ( i dont remember the exact name) was such that paneer was separate with sweat like water in between gravy ( that ussually happens when the food turns bad) but who cares here.: 1.4879340788699233, the restaurant manager is least bothered about food quality.: 1.9499705709240729, the veg biryani was again super super spice again to make stale food edible.: 1.1471453796350795,

ill because of eating this pathetic food.: 1.2601530311948204, Believe me I was terrified- TERRIFIED to find a cockroach in water served at PUNJABI BY NATURE.: 0.3890523837551501, To top it all the restaurant manager refused to write an apology It was only when I blew my top did he agree to write on reverse of bill.: 1.0223660977045321, Being a hotelier myself I think any apology is unpardonable.: 0.08652148322542673, I was offered free food: 1.0659211300765157, but I insisted on paying only to convince them I'm not looking for freebies.: 0.09711595055915244, VISIT:

restaurant as we wanted to have a perfect experience of a good punjabi dinner.: 1.5732783990582695, Our hotel suggested punjabi by nature, I repeatedly asked them, is it better than have more at pandara road and Pindar balluchi as we had eaten there earlier and wanted to try something new but not at the cost of bad food.: 1.8911124190700412, The reason I am taking time to write this review is that I hated this restaurant and our experience here so much that I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake.: 1.3490288404944084, When we sat to order, as usual we first wanted to order starters, as we love a Kabab with a drink, so we ordered an amritsari chicken tikka and dahi kabab veg,which was suggested by the waiter.: 1.3702177751618596, Firstly the prices were crazy, 600 rs for a starter was ridiculous, then when I saw the starter I understood because the chicken tikka was a huge log of chicken, it was unnecessarily so big that it didn't leave any space for us to try anything else.: 0.783402001177163, Also the veg dahi kabab was so sour, it definitely deserved a miss.: 0.10771041789287816, We got so full trying to finish the starter that we just couldn't enjoy anything else.: 0.21718658034137728, To worsen things the service was slow, poor and sloppy, it took them 15 min to just get a drink for me, when I ordered a second roti, it didn't come for almost 20 min, when I asked again the waiter had forgotten and said pls wait will get it shortly.: 1.8669805768098884, I said enough let's just put an end to this miserable experience.: 0.5050029429075927,

good, the service is pathetic.: 1.866391995291348, They have thali system so you have to keep calling the servers to refill your bowls, but for that you need to have a lot of patience as they take a

incident but we were all annoyed because we had survived so well through travelling the rest of India and the famous Delhi belly got us on the last night.: 0.455562095350206, We got today there, first impression was that the staff always pointed at the breakfast buffet, even when we said that we know that there is a buffet, but that we wanted to see the card first..: 0.9558563861094761, he pointed again and again.: 0.00824014125956445, Felt like the rickshaw drivers following you at the train station.  : 0.06945261918775751, The buffet has 2 parts: one the buffet table where you can take as

expectations after reading so many good reviews on this site but to my surprise the place was a very smallish cafe and the food that they had on offer was Pathetic  i took a group of 50 people in here after reading the reviews here and we tried 5 different bread and 5 pastries and they were all stale and were smelling bad as well -i was astonished to see so many foreign tourist in this place, probably thinking that this is the best Delhi has to offer the staff was polite and the service was good the prices too were reasonable but when i go to a bakery i expect good food - but they didn't have anything good with them it seems this place is only good for people who are running short on cash and would eat crap if it is served cheap i have seen the previous reviews here and they all seem fake as i can see people decided only to review this restaurant/cafe in Delhi(only 1-2 reviews ever given by these people) whereas there is a lot more to have in Delhi Don't bother coming here!: 9.545615067686871, This place is so over-priced and not worth your money!: 0.7422012948793408, There are way better, cheaper places a few metres away with just as good food.: 1.5467922307239552, I

However, we ate here a couple of times over the course of a few days staying upstairs at Ajay, and were disappointed with every single thing we ordered.: 0.701589170100059, It was cold when it was supposed to be warm, warm when it was supposed to be cold, too salty, too sweet, undercooked, overcooked, etc., etc.  : 0.3160682754561507, The worst was probably when we tried the buffet breakfast after reading great things about it, and being encouraged by reading that they didn't use heating plates because it didn't meet their hygienic standards.: 0.5014714537963509, I assumed this to mean that things like eggs, sausage, potatoes would be cooked to order.: 0.37492642731018244, Unfortunately, it just seemed to mean they were all cooked hours in advance and then put away, not even reheated before being served.: 0.3502060035314891, They were all cold, with the sausage looking (and tasting) like it had been cooked several days prior.: 0.3013537374926427, As far as the fruit salad, meusli, yogurt, cheese, bread, etc.: 0.09005297233666863, It all sat out on a table, which, in the 40 minutes or so that we sat there, none of the attendants even went near.:

to me.: 1.070629782224838, The cheese looked crusty and the fruit salad, which I made the mistake of trying, was mushy and tasted more like the air in the room than it did like fruit.:

ask for it), eitherways as she was getting it the floor manager stopped her and asked her probably where she was taking the form and when she indicated to our table he shook his head, she must have said that we've asked for it - because he then shrugged and indicated okay.  : 1.3984696880517953, Well, I don't think they would have taken a look at my forlorn feedback note - so felt compelled to

small carpet area the guests are all almost falling onto each other.  : 0.22366097704532079, The food served here is also below average and the prices definitely are way high in comparison to the ambience, service, the quality of food and the potion size they provide.: 3.20364920541495, The staff taking the order or serving the guest does not follow simple instructions and are just wandering

unprofessional service.: 0.7115950559152442, The owner should spend some more time to train the staff in order to offer the best service, or start to sell garlic naans on the corner of a street, where

and the generosity of its staff”.  : 2.3490288404944084, Along that line, some of the finest dining experiences I had have been in the diners and dives scattered throughout the south Delhi area, regrettably, Essex Farm’s restaurant is not among these gems now.  : 0.8134196586227193, The location of the restaurant and its presence makes it appear promising with open spaces and facilities catering to various age groups and needs.: 0.6662742789876398, Because the place has open areas, the restaurant provides outdoor and indoor seating.: 1.1748087110064742, I approached the restaurant, fully intending to take a seat outside, especially for my grandfather who is in his 90s and can’t climb the steps.: 0.6032960565038258, I reached the restaurant with my wife 45 minutes earlier to book a table outdoor; while my parents were on the way from Ghaziabad along with my grandfather.: 1.1736315479693935, We requested to meet the manager and sat down to a table inside.: 0.581518540317834, Meanwhile looking around, I only noticed two other customers, as it was 8:00 PM on a Sunday evening; the indoor/outdoor seating was relatively empty with no bookings.: 0.2672160094173043, Fifteen minutes later a representative arrived and we made a request to take an outdoor seating for 5 persons with a reason of my grandfather’s condition.  : 0.27898763978811064, The request was declined immediately with a response of some internal management issues.: 0.12124779281930548, After another 15 minutes passed, my parents arrived along with my grandfather.: 0.20070629782224841, My father

0.5191288993525603, After hearing these discouraging/changing remarks and having my grandfather standing and waiting outside in open, we decided to go some place rather than discussing further with the management.  : 0.8581518540317834, Visiting the Essex Farm Restaurant was certainly an experience to remember, but one that I never hope to repeat and would not wish upon anyone else Avoid this

charging through phone was attempted by AmEx but the calls were disconnected by the staff siting some excuse.: 0.377869334902884, To add to this the restaurant is charging tax (VAT) on service charges

changed.: 0.6427310182460271, To complicate the matter further, the waiters were highly arrogant as if I came for a free dinner.: 0.4573278399058269, My view is one can get good food anywhere in city.: 1.3443201883460858, It is the quality of service that distinguishes restaurant specially when they are charging a good price.: 1.5785756327251323, I am highly disappointed with this restaurant and request the management to please look into this matter and provide some training (read manners) to the staff so that people can enjoy rather than complain.: 1.3195997645673927, But the service was non-existent, after being given our menus, quickly choosing and closing them... we waited... and waited... on the balcony by the door the staff ignored and ignored, I stared into the passing staff member one last time and he actively looked away and ignored me, so we walked out.: 1.683343143025309, Time and time again these \"cool\" hipster-style places are reviewed as the latest and greatest but in reality it's shoddy service under the guise of \"having a relaxed atmosphere\" or some other rubbish.: 0.8769864626250736, Now at \"La Vie\" where they actually acknowledge you and take your order without you growing old.: 0.2554443790464979, Went for a business meeting to this place.: 0.6180105944673338, Beautifully decorated with Dharam pajis pics and village looks.:

vacate the table when the staff realised I wasn't placing a second order quickly!: 0.8475573866980577, I was doing some writing work, after having their pomegranate juice, and despite that, the waiters came to my table almost 5 times to ask me (condescendingly) if I wanted to place another order, because there were \"more people waiting in que for a table and I should otherwise shift to another smaller table\".: 2.4720423778693346, Don't EVER visit this place, because it is misogynistic and has nasty staff, and the quality of the food is overpriced and terrible.: 2.2513243084167156, The pomegranate juice hardly tasted like it had real pomegranate in it, and even their cheese cake which I had some weeks/months ago, did not taste all that good at all.: 0.6856974690994703, The worst cake I've ever eaten in my life!: 0.20364920541494996, Had ordered an apple-cinnamon cake, baked nachos and masala chai.: 0.3566804002354326, Apart from the masala chai (which they couldn't foul up even if they tried as it was tea bag tea), everything else was pathetic.: 0.20364920541494996, The cake takes the cake when it comes to poorly baked cakes- raw, dense, squidgy with nary a hint of either apple or cinnamon!: 0.13772807533843434, The baked nachos were hardly baked at all- struggled to find traces of the cheese on top- even my cheese fanatic toddler was disappointed!: 0.17951736315479694, The worst was the appalling attitude of the staff- when informed of the horrible cake, they did not offer to replace and instead tried arguing that cakes were supposed to be like that.: 0.45497351383166573, Also, when the bill was paid, they conveniently 'forgot' to pay us back the change in coins (had given them RS 1000 for a Rs 598 bill and was returned Rs 400).: 0.6391995291347852, Though I know Rs 2 would not make any difference to anyone, it was still absolutely unprofessional on the part of the staff to assume things for granted.: 0.5214832254267215,

negative rating on TripAdvisor, these guys would have surely earned it!: 0.07474985285462037, As the name suggested everyone who is dharmender fan or like theme restaurants wants to go there , but believe me there is nothing so special about this place.: 0.7527957622130665, Restaurant owners just spent their money on the ambience which is again not very special but an average one.: 0.3549146556798117, Food was not fresh and quantity was very less.: 0.16127133608004707, We asked them for some International wines but they served us local wine on the name of international brand.:

0.8911124190700412, We found that to be a benevolent act on his part, however that continued several times in the evening.: 0.21365509123013537, Either certain items need to be removed from the menu, or servers need to be taught how to sell the items the restaurant cum bar has.: 0.9823425544437904, Later, we ordered chicken drum sticks, which the server suggested would be spicy.: 0.5844614479105356, However, they were so sweet.: 0.031783402001177165, We asked to change that, and were given the same dish with spices put on top.: 0.4614479105356092, That was not edible at all.: 0.007651559741024131, It was shocking to have that same dish served to us as well.: 0.37610359034726304, We know this for a fact as that dish was brought back to the table within five minutes.: 0.761035903472631, We then spoke to the manager, Nitin, who agreed to replace the dish.: 0.3790464979399647, They suggested Tava Chicken to us, saying that it is delicious and spicy.: 0.14714537963507945, When we tried it, it tasted like potato.: 0.14714537963507945, We had just one spoon before calling the server over again.: 0.0694526191877575, No apologies were given by them, even though we had ordered another round of drinks (total drinks amount of more than INR 6000).: 0.5591524426133019, Instead, they stated that the dish would be charged and cannot be removed from the bill.: 0.3443201883460859, We found that to be problematic, purely because those dishes had been suggested by their servers and we had consumed nothing from it.: 0.20247204237786937, The service was not hospitable and accommodating.: 0.46144791053560924, Sometimes, servers need to take their customers seriously.: 0.13655091230135374, We were also ignored by the server when we directly addressed him several times when he was less than half a feet away from the table.: 0.48028251912889935, When this was brought to the attention of the manager, there was absolutely no reaction.: 0.27074749852854624, Overall, a disappointing experience.: 0.3266627427898764, It is unfortunate that we are being forced to pay service charge for such inconsiderate and unaccommodating service.:

portions, huge price, limited menu, appalling coffee, grumpy staff - but the decor is lovely and the bookshop below so charming (I'm presuming they are unconnected as surely the same management couldn't produce 2 such differing results????): 1.244261330194232, so I decided to give it another try.: 0.1377280753384344, HUGE MISTAKE.: 0.002354326074161271, The food is really poor (can't believe reviewers have written things like 'amazing' about this food - are they serious?????): 2.2324896998234256, This is the kind of bland, faux western food that would be bad enough if it was cheap, but instead it is served in mini portions and massively overpriced.: 1.5768098881695114, Pathetic.: 0.022366097704532076, On top of all that, we had to pay a service charge when the waitress was rude enough almost to be described as abusive.: 0.6892289582107121, The same girl who was rude to us last time!: 0.34961742201294876, To the owner of this place: you have some SERIOUS staff training

ordered.: 0.4302530900529723, Now when we asked for a repeat and realized that we were cheated.. the waiter started blaming us that they served what was ordered and we will have to pay for it.: 1.0064743967039433, Inspite of even pointing out on the menu while ordering, the waiter did not even bother to repeat them to us.  : 0.3619776339022955, My friends who came to India after almost two years were all excited to taste our old Kingfisher.: 0.5903472630959388, We somehow decided to move to a nearby bar after we speak to the manager.  : 0.3331371394938199, Then came the self proclaimed head and the owner of the restaurant bar \"Karishma\" who was even afraid to tell us her last name.: 0.8675691583284286, Initially she spoke to us as if she will settle our bills as per what we ordered.: 0.29370217775161855, Two of us took turns to explain the situation to these dumb waiters and dumber \"Karishma\".: 0.20659211300765157, As per her logic the beverages listed on ther menu were not available for last couple of months which they did not feel to inform.: 0.3319599764567392, They simply noded at the time of ordering and gave us what they had!: 0.33902295467922305, I still feel hilarious when I think of \"Karishma\" in spite of explaining her the whole story in english and hindi she understood what she wanted to! and gave completely a different story and tried to project us as criminals who would run away without paying to the original manager who showed up later.: 0.6368452030606238, Maybe she was under a huge pressure of handeling her microphone strapped to her head a d a couple of tables in her section or maybe she was really feeling the pressure of the position she claimed to be at ;) .: 0.1877575044143614, Nevertheless she somehow called her senior who finally came to rescue us from her and settled the bill as per our order like a true Manager.: 0.694526191877575, No doubt the place was really good and spacious with good music and ambiance but the behaviour of their staff ruined everything.: 1.5620953502060033, Specially \"Karishma\" who repeatedly denied to reveal her own last name was a combination of fun and dumb.  :

thinking as it is pre-made and kept, it could just be unfortunate.: 0.07769276044732196, However the second (hair in raita) was unacceptable which was unfortunately spotted when we were almost through with dinner.: 0.20306062389640966, The handling of the whole episode by the corporate manager on duty then, was really annoying.: 0.22542672160094174, Instead of being apologetic, he had the cheek to

place didn't want guests to \"screw them\" by eating/drinking A LOT.: 0.9228958210712184, The restaurant staff's attitude was disgusting, they were monitoring what we ate and how soon we ate, they changed the terms of the deal arbitrarily saying this is what their management told them to do inspite of the groupon voucher clearly stating otherwise.: 1.2825191288993527, The food portions were not

same the reason offered was that the dish that was swapped for our original order has the same price as the one we had ordered.: 0.7539729252501471, I wondered why a new bill could not be raised by the staff or is there any hanky panky business that was covered in the guise of same pricing..   : 0.5326662742789875, This is then the service you can expect if you ever visit this place.: 1.1742201294879342, My personal recommendation is never again will I attempt another meal here even if it is provided free of cost.: 0.214832254267216, The prices doesn't justify the quality of service which is far better at a roadside dabha or even a poorly rated restaurant.: 1.3578575632725132, It seems the staff has been riding on the brand name and it's time the management takes some notice of their services before its brand is forgotten and buried for good.: 1.0135373749264271, Horrible service.: 0.47675103001765745, Waiters and hostesses keep gossiping amongst themselves and

something that you expect to see at a fine dining Restraunt!: 0.12948793407886994, We asked the guy taking our order for recommendations and were told the massaman curry is one of their best dishes so we ordered that and were advised to take truflle corn rice with it which was an odd choice but the server insisted the combination works very well so we went with his suggestion!: 1.4537963507945844, After a while another server came to check if we have ordered the mains...we told him what he had ordered and he insisted we change the rice as it doesn't go with it at All!: 1.0847557386698057, So we

appetizer of ribs!!!: 0.22071806945261918, More than the menu stated just to add insult to injury.: 0.20070629782224836, Think twice before eating here.: 0.07357268981753973, Worst experience ever!: 0.29605650382577986, Terrible management; ‘Manager Mohit’ is totally unprofessional and completely unrepentant for poor customer service Have been to this place a few times in the past and generally had a decent experience.  : 1.692760447321954, Wanted to book the place for a private event and visited 2-3 times to finalise details re exclusive space, menu, drinks selection, cost etc.: 1.0523837551500883, After everything was finalized (over a week and more than one visit), we wanted to pay a security deposit that the ‘manager’ had said we could pay whenever convenient.: 0.7133608004708651, This was more than 2 weeks before the event was to take place and we had been assured that the date and place had been blocked for our party.: 1.14832254267216, When we went over to the restaurant to pay the deposit, the ‘Manager’, Mohit something-or-the-other, started acting really weird about the space that we had finalized.: 0.9175985874043555, Our Sunday afternoon event was for 30 people and we had agreed to take the entire bar/lounge area that seated around 20 and had sufficient open space for guests to mill around.: 0.46792230723955275, ‘Manager Mohit’ then tried to convince us that we didn’t need the space that we had agreed on but that he was willing to give us a smaller space within the lounge area.: 0.21188934667451442, This meant that our 30 guests would have seating space for 10 and much less standing room than would have been comfortable.: 0.15832842848734552, Further, there was the possibility that other guests of the restaurant could also be seated in the same section where our private party was to take place.: 1.2401412595644496, The buffet menu given to us was also now a problem and we were instead being told to take the Sunday brunch menu instead.: 0.6562683931724543, All this after everything having been discussed and finalized.: 0.05650382577987051, ‘Manager Mohit’ kept acting up and finally we lost our patience and asked to speak to his boss.: 0.3290170688640377, What followed was a bizarre conversation with him blubbering about there being ‘owners’ who he could talk to but him being the ‘manager’ who had the final word.: 0.27839905826957034, And that he had a boss: 0.0017657445556209534, but he didn’t need to check with him; or that he had checked with his boss and was merely following instructions; but that he was the ‘manager’ and didn’t need to check with anyone… it went round and round in circles and, frustratingly for us, it finally became clear to us that ‘Manager Mohit’ had no intention of letting us speak to any of his superiors or honoring his commitment to us and that we had wasted our time dealing with the restaurant, had lost out on good deals with other venues because we liked Fio Cookhouse and ‘Manager Mohit’, up to that point of time had seemed helpful.: 2.2165979988228366, When we finally gave up and informed ‘Manager Mohit’ that we wanted to drop the entire thing and move our event elsewhere, he hinted that he had received enquiries from someone else for the same date/time as our event (which may explain a lot).: 0.6727486756915833, The entire episode left us feeling cheated and disappointed.: 0.22366097704532079, We have never had such a problem with any other venue and this experience has ensured that we will never visit Fio Cookhouse ever again.: 0.4484991171277222, Just thought sharing this might help other people avoid going through similar experience.: 0.6639199529134785, Expectations were high but nothing was up to the mark....a themed dhaba has a better decor than yours....and benches are more comfortable than your sofas...and at the last food was pathetic...: 1.3496174220129487, MIX flavours didn't go together at all...NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS LUXURY

injury, was practically inedible, not having been grilled enough.: 0.18540317834020012, I myself gave up after trying to chew my way through.: 0.14596821659799883, Completely disgusted, we abandoned our idea of dinner, and asked for the cheque.  : 0.3761035903472631, Everything we ate was average in taste, very small in portions, and outrageously priced.  : 0.40200117716303707, I had the feeling that they deliberately serve small portions so that you are compelled to order more.: 0.4131842260153031, The food that you get for the money you pay here is a downright shame, and the place [excuse my language] is a complete rip-off.: 1.7828134196586227, The service is indifferent at best, and one gets the feeling that the restaurant is doing you a favour by allowing you inside.: 1.11065332548558, An unpleasant experience, and I am not going back!: 0.37139493819894054, That there can be a slight difference in food and service quality in different restaurants of the same group is to be expected.: 1.8140082401412592, One has been a regular of the restaurant in the Garden of Five Senses where both the food and service have always been exceptional and one had come here for lunch in a large family with a similar expectation.: 2.3602118893466746, The restaurant was fairly quiet but in spite of that the servers were slow and disinterested.: 0.633313713949382, The fig and

matter when he returned and we could look forward to a proper meal the next time round.: 0.8475573866980575, The final icing though was the bill that included both the returned in edible pasta dishes.: 0.32901706886403764, When I protested the manager told me that they had removed the portion of fries and sprite we had ordered for my grand daughter as a goodwill gesture !:

my fingers.: 1.7245438493231307, The server was near me and helped with removing one of the smaller pieces that was lodged a bit deeper.: 0.1330194231901118, Although I had asked her if she could
